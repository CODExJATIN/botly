# What Can Botly Do?

Botly is a flexible AI assistant that you can drop into any app — React frontend, Node.js backend, or custom UIs via direct API access.

This page highlights **core capabilities**, and how to use them effectively.

## 🔍 1. Real-Time Conversations

### Example

<CodeBlock language="json">
{`{
  "userMessage": "Tell me where india is located?"
}`}
</CodeBlock>

Response:

<CodeBlock language="json">
{`{
  "botResponse": "India is a vast country located in South Asia. It is a peninsula, meaning it's largely surrounded by water."
}`}
</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="info" title="Good To Know">
You only need to send a single field: `userMessage`.

All personalization, context awareness, and intelligence are handled internally by Botly’s AI — no need to manage additional fields or session data.

Just pass plain input like:

👉 `"userMessage": "What can you do?"`

Botly takes care of the rest.

## 📦 2. Easily Deployable Anywhere

- ✅ React-based frontends (via `botly-bots`)  
- ✅ Node.js CLI tools or servers (via `botlyapi`)  
- ✅ Any platform via direct HTTP requests

Botly works without needing a full UI — even a cronjob or webhook can talk to it.

## 🎨 3. Fully Customizable UI

Using the `botly-bots` React component:

- Change assistant name, title, default prompt  
- Customize styles with your own CSS or framework  
- Theme it with Tailwind, Chakra, etc.

<CodeBlock language="jsx">
{`<BotlyBot 
  apiKey={yourKey}
  title="Health Assistant"
  initialMessage="Hey! How can I support your wellness today?"
/>`}
</CodeBlock>

<h3>⚠️ 4. Smart Error Responses</h3>

<p>Botly replies with clear error messages when something goes wrong.</p>

<table className="text-left">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>HTTP Code</th>
      <th className="text-center">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="text-center">401</td>
      <td>Missing or invalid API key</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="text-center">429</td>
      <td>Rate limit hit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="text-center">500</td>
      <td>Internal server error</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can catch these in <code>.catch()</code> or <code>try-catch</code> blocks when using SDKs.</p>
